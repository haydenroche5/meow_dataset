# meow_dataset
A dataset of cat meow audio. All clips are sampled at 16 kHz. Samples are 16-bit signed integers.

## File naming convention
Each file name has a prefix that tells you the source it came from.
- *kaggle* clips comes from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mmoreaux/audio-cats-and-dogs).
- *youtube* clips come from YouTube videos, i.e. youtube_\<VIDEO ID\>, where video ID is the string after the v= at the end of a YouTube URL (e.g. "acm9dCI5_dc" from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acm9dCI5_dc).
- *newton* clips are my cat Newton meowing, recorded by me.
